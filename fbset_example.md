One possible use of fbset together with a bash script drawing rectangle in framebuffer modes set by fbset is to create a simple slideshow of different colored rectangles on the screen. Here is an example of such a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the frame buffer device node
FBDEV=/dev/fb0

# Define some colors in RGB565 format
RED=0xF800
GREEN=0x07E0
BLUE=0x001F
YELLOW=0xFFE0
CYAN=0x07FF
MAGENTA=0xF81F
WHITE=0xFFFF
BLACK=0x0000

# Define a function to draw a rectangle with a given color and position
draw_rect() {
  # Get the color and position parameters
  local color=$1
  local x=$2
  local y=$3
  local w=$4
  local h=$5

  # Convert the color to hexadecimal string
  local hex_color=$(printf "%04X" $color)

  # Loop through the height of the rectangle
  for ((i = 0; i < h; i++)); do
    # Calculate the offset in the frame buffer
    local offset=$((y + i))
    offset=$((offset * 1920 * 2))
    offset=$((offset + x * 2))

    # Write the color to the frame buffer using dd command
    dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=$((w * 2)) 2>/dev/null | tr "\000" "\x${hex_color:2:2}\x${hex_color:0:2}" | dd of=$FBDEV bs=1 seek=$offset conv=notrunc 2>/dev/null
  done
}

# Clear the screen with black color
draw_rect $BLACK 0 0 1920 1200

# Draw some rectangles with different colors and positions
draw_rect $RED 100 100 400 300
draw_rect $GREEN 600 100 400 300
draw_rect $BLUE 1100 100 400 300
draw_rect $YELLOW 100 500 400 300
draw_rect $CYAN 600 500 400 300
draw_rect $MAGENTA 1100 500 400 300

# Wait for a key press to exit
read -n1 -r -p "Press any key to exit..." key

# Clear the screen again with black color
draw_rect $BLACK 0 0 1920 1200

```

This script assumes that the frame buffer device is /dev/fb0 and the resolution is set to **1920x1200**. You can use fbset to change the resolution before running the script, for example:

```bash
fbset -fb /dev/fb0 -g **1024** **768** **1024** **768** **16**
```

This will change the resolution to **1024x768**. You can also use different values for the geometry parameters, as long as they are supported by your frame buffer device. You can check the available modes by using:

```bash
cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes
```

For more information about fbset, you can refer to its manual pageÂ² or this Stack Overflow questionÂ¹. I hope this helps you understand how to use fbset and bash script to draw rectangles on the screen. ðŸ˜Š
